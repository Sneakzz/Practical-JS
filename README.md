# Practical Javascript 

This project was made while following and learning from the Watch And Code free practical javascript course.

During this course, we create a todo-list web application that grows in functionality as well as complexity over multiple versions.

------ IMPORTANT ------

Since completion of the practical javascript course this project has been a WIP. 

Things that have been added, Changed or removed include but are not limited to:

* Removed the original UI and replaced it with a modern, minimalistic and mobile and user friendly UI.
* Added styling to the entire UI to go with the structure as there previously was no structure or styling.
* Removed, added and/or refactored most of the original javascript code from the course to go with the new UI and to add additional features.

### Current goals for the project

* Add local storage features to store todo's over multiple days
* Think of more features to add!

### What i've learned so far:

* Data types: the differences between primitives and objects. How to create them and how they work.
* Functions: learned how to create them, use them, customize them, the use of variables and arguments inside functions. And callback functions.
* Methods: using functions inside of objects to create methods, learn what they do and how to use them effectively.
* Logic: learned about booleans, what they are and how they're used. Also creating logical statements and understanding how, why and when they're used to make the application "smarter".
* Loops: creating loops, how they work and their use. Then using that knowledge to our advantage to make certain tasks easier. Also learned about alternatives to loops.
* DOM and HTML: learned what the Document Object Model is, how it works, what it does, its purpose and how to manipulate it using javascript.
* Chrome debugger: using the built-in chrome debugger to find problems and see exactly how things work. Also learned about the different options and functionality inside the debugger.
* this: learned about and using the keyword "this". Also understanding how it works and behaves in different situations.
* objects: how to create objects, store, manipulate and use values for logic, behaviour,.., Also how objects can be used to structure code and functionality into their own groups with their own methods.
* ES6: Learned about the features of the newest version of ECMAScript and how things like "const", "let", "arrow functions", "template strings" and more work and are used.
