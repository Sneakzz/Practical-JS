# Practical Javascript 

This project was made while following and learning from the Watch And Code free practical javascript course.

During this course, we create a todo-list web application that grows in functionality as well as complexity over multiple versions.

### What i've learned so far:

* Data types: the differences between primitives and objects. How to create them and how they work.
* Functions: learned how to create them, use them, customize them, the use of variables and arguments inside functions. And callback functions.
* Methods: using functions inside of objects to create methods, learn what they do and how to use them effectively.
* Logic: learned about booleans, what they are and how they're used. Also creating logical statements and understanding how, why and when they're used to make the application "smarter".
* Loops: creating loops, how they work and their use. Then using that knowledge to our advantage to make certain tasks easier. Also learned about alternatives to loops.
* DOM and HTML: learned what the Document Object Model is, how it works, what it does, its purpose and how to manipulate it using javascript.
* Chrome debugger: using the built-in chrome debugger to find problems and see exactly how things work. Also learned about the different options and functionality inside the debugger.
* this: learned about and using the keyword "this". Also understanding how it works and behaves in different situations.
